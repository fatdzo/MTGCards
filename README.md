# MTGCards
Trying to look at MTG cards through an OOP Paradigm lens.
## Introduction
This is a cass library project implemented in c# programming language. I thought this project would be a perfect starting point for you if your are trying to build some software that would deal with MTG cards or you would like to create your own card game. My personal interest is research of the MTG card game.
###This is still a work progress. 
I am planning on adding a bunch of things to this project. If you are interested in this project and you would like to know more about the project let me know. Also, any suggestions are more then welcome.

Rock on!
