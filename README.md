# MTGCards
Trying to look at MTG cards through an OOP Paradigm lens.
## Introduction
This is a class library project implemented in C# programming language. I thought this project would be a perfect starting point for you if your are trying to build some software that would deal with MTG cards or you would like to create your own card game. I would like to use this Source code for my own personal research of the game. Let me know if you find any use in all of this, I would love to hear about it.
### This is still a work progress. 
I am planning on adding a bunch of things to this project. If you are interested in this project and you would like to know more about the project let me know. Also, any suggestions are more then welcome.
#### Magic is a complex game, and I am trying to eat that elephant one bite at a time. I am probably getting some things wrong so bear with me.
Rock on!
